Functionality
- I used two web services (Songsterr and TheAudioDB)
- Local storage works in Vue
- A language option for the artist bios supplies the required control
- There are some errors in the console if the user searches something beyond the databases, although it shouldn't crash

Design & Interaction
- I think I have a nice looking page and layout which also adjusts to displays
- The App is not confusing and is simple to use

HTML/CSS/Media
- Html is valid besides errors and warnings concerning the use of vue
- css is valid

Code
-Vue used
-Ajax used
-Custom Class used
-Custom component is written but not implemented due to bootstrap issuses that I showed you in the last class

Impact
- It is not what I wanted for the project after trying TasteDive for reccomendations, but I am happy that I found TheAudioDB as I think there is lots of potential using 
the API more and it is more of what I envisioned when I wanted to use the Spotifyt API
- I don't think its portfolio worthy yet, needs some more visual tweaks and better page updates and error handiling

I struggled with getting the first API I wanted to use around CORS, I was stubborn and wanted to try and figure it out and I waited too long.
Finals were not kind to me time wise and so I underestimated how much time I would put into this project.
Since the first API didn't get working and I had little time I went with a new API and tried my best to make it work.
I think the core of the app is still there, there's just no reccomendations at the moment
Most of my extra controls were going to focus on filtering out the reccomendations.
I'm happy with how it looks and I improved the way my table looked.

I want to try and add things like the previously mentioned reccomendations, improving how the page updates to better inform the user and handle errors,
and improve search functionality to support searching for albums or songs and not just artists.
